pyTNC
=====

pyTNC is a software-implemented Terminal Node Controller, intended for use in amateur radio, written in Python.

Currently, it is not yet developed enough to be used.

Costs of traditional hardware TNCs can be prohibitive, discouraging ham radio operators from trying APRS or other packet radio. However, the average, modern sound card included with all user-facing computers is more than capable of producing and receiving audio sufficient to be used in packet radio. Some software exists for this, but very little of it is cross-platform, and none of it (as far as I can tell) is written in Python.

This package aims to rectify that deficiency and make packet radio accessible to everyone with a computer, handheld transceiver, and a way to interface the two (serial and audio connections).
